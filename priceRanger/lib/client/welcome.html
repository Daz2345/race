    <h3>Price & Range Scenario Planner is dunnhumbys newest solution to enable the correct price and range of products that keeps both your customers and bean counters happy</h3>
    <hr>
    
    <p>The Price & Range Scenario Planner is a new solution designed to bring together our ranging science from Shelf Review and our pricing science from Price Strat. This will enable the end user to make price and range changes in a single solution, producing both total scenario and line level outcomes, measured by a change in sales/volume. By incorporating this with the latest analysis on the effects of delisting products and NPD performance, Price & Range Scenario Planner also allows the user to add new products and remove poorly performing products to understand the potential effect of doing so, before making any final decisions.
<br>
As well as being part of the Global Capabilities road map, this solution will be a key asset in the next phase of the Tesco Category Reset program. Itâ€™s primary use will be in the planning stage to help buyers make customer led decisions when constructing a range. Previously dunnhumby has not operated in this space but this capability is vital in order to stay competitive and offer end-to-end solutions for our retail partners. 
<br>
There are some further developments on the horizon as we refine the model. These include: the measured effect of product distribution changes and customer measures as part of the output.
